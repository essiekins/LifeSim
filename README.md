Choosey Life

Summary
Choose. Live. Die.
A multiple choice story-driven game where your choices inpact the rest of your life.

Rules
Players are presented with four (4) options A though D, that will lead to another 4 options, and so on.
Options will be chosen by the player without prior knowledge of the resulting outcome.
Once their imediate fortune is told, story line will unfold, and another 4 options will be displayed for their next stage in life.

Life Stages
During the first few rounds, players start as new born with anywhere from 10 to 100 life points. The amount of points the player recieves at the start are dependant on the first 3 rounds: their parents, economic status, and health status.

Each round of options adds or deducts to the player's life points.

Win and Lose conditions:
Each option per round has a point value attatched to it that will be displayed over the animated window for said scene, detailing how many points out of 200 they have accumulated so far.
Bad life outcomes like 'getting arrested' and 'breaking a leg' would reduce points from your overall life, while 'recieving a promotion' and 'getting fit' would add positive points in the player's total. 
If too many negative points happen, and the counter goes below 20 points, the game is lost.
If the ending score by the end of the storyline is over 150, the game is won with different tiers.

Winning tiers at end of game, and Life Points:
If the player life towards the end of the game is over 190, they lived a perfect life.
If over 160- great life
If over 130, average life
if over 100, poor life
anything under 100 is a tragedy and a game lost, even if the end of the storyline
